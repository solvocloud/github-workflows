# Common reusable workflow for PR-related events.
# A reference to this workflow should be made by other repositories, in workflows that
# deal with pull requests (i.e. having "on" -> "pull_request" in their header).

# The idea is to have this common workflow contain whatever jobs and steps needed for all
# PR-related events.
